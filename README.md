This is the source code for the installation and control app for the first version of
Native SBS support for Android. Native SBS makes it possible to use all apps (like Plex,
Play Movies, Netflix, etc.) with opendive, google cardboard or similar for viewing on a large
virtual screen.

Before you go ahead and install this app make sure that you have root and a working recovery in
case something goes horribly wrong.

The code that is the core of this functionality is not part of any open API so the compatibility
of this app needs to be tested on a per android version and device type.

When you have installed and enabled SBS (in the app) your device might fail to boot. If you
selected the option of only enable "on next boot" you can just power off and power on the phone
again and it *should* boot fine. If you select the "Dangerous" option you might not be so lucky.

If your device fails to boot, read the "To manually undo everything SBS has done to your device"
chapter below.

- *The beta version* has only been tested on AOKP_jflte_kitkat_nightly_2014-05-24 (AOKP based on 4.4.2 on Samsung
  S4 - I9505), but probably works with most CM11 based KitKat roms. (And possibly some KitKat stock
  ROMs)
- *The alpha version" has only been tested on Nexus 5 - GPE5.0.1 and CM12 on SGS4/I9505
   (cm-12-20150308-NIGHTLY-jfltexx.zip), but probably works with other CM12 based AOSP Lollipopp roms.
- If the phone hangs, reboot it.
- I use it with a bluetooth mouse and have watched hours and hours of movies with it (mostly when flying).

I have a lot of projects, a day-job and not much time for this project, in addition estetics and user interfaces aren't my 
strong side. So if someone wants to help rewrite this into something neater I'd appreciate the help.

Please report success and fail with device name and os version in the community https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/117807409036006925326?cfem=1

Some ideas:

I1) Enable/disable in a way that works in both SBS and non-sbs mode. Since using the touch-screen is hard in SBS mode.
I2) Lens distortion correction (any opengl-wizards out there that would like to help ?)
I3) Incorporate the change in some open source ROMS (the patch is quite small and isolated but does need some work)
I4) Add permanent installation option.
I5) Make individual zoom settings for landscape and portrait mode.
I6) Make zoom settings persistent



To manually undo everything SBS has done to your device

1) Boot into recovery and connect to your phone with adb
2) Mount /system read/write

   mount -o rw /system

3) Restore /system binaries

   mv /system/bin/surfaceflinger.real /system/bin/surfaceflinger

4) Remove sbs binaries
   rm -rf /system/lib/sbs

5) Unmount /system again
   
   umount /system
   
6) Reboot phone
   
   reboot
